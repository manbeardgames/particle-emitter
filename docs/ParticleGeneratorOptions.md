# ParticleGeneratorOptions Struct
Namespace: ParticleEmitter

Stores the values of the options for how particles are generated by the Emitter.

```csharp
public struct ParticleGeneratorOptions
```

# Constructors
| Signature | Description |
|---|---|
| ParticleGeneratorOptions() | Initializes a new instance of the ParticleGeneratorOptions |

# Properties
| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Color | Color | The color mask to apply to all particles generated. |
| Count | int | The total number of particles to generate. |
| EmissionType | EmissionType | The type of emission the applied to the generated particles. |
| Fade | bool | Should the particles fade out over time before being destoryed. |
| RotationVelocity | MinMaxFloat | The minimum and maximum velocity to apply to the rotation of the generated particles. |
| Scale | MinMaxFloat | The minimum and maximum scale to apply to the x and y render of the generated particles. |
| Texture | Texture2D | The texture to apply to all particles generated. |
| TimeToLive | MinMaxFloat | The minimum and maximum time allowed for particles to live. |
| Velocity | MinMaxFloat | The minimum and maximum velocity allowed for the generated particles. |


# Example
The following is an example of creating a new ParticleGeneratorOptions instance 

```csharp
//  Create the generator options for our particle emitter
ParticleGeneratorOptions generatorOptions = new ParticleGeneratorOptions()
{
    //  EmiisionType determines how the xy-velocity of the particles are calculated.  
    //  Emissiontype.Burst will randomly make the x and/or y velocity positive or negative
    //  EmissionType.UpOnly will only calcuate the y veolocity so that the particles will move up from the emitter
    //  EmissionType.DownOnly will only calculate the y velocity so that the particles move down from the emitter
    //  EmissionType.LeftOnly will only calculate the x velocity so that the particles move left from the emitter
    //  EmissionType.RightOnly will only calculate the x velocity so that the particles move right from the emitter
    EmissionType = EmissionType.Burst,

    //  Texture is the Texture2D used to render the particles that are generated with these
    //  options
    Texture = Content.Load<Texture2D>("demoParticle"),

    //  Color is the color mask used to render the particles
    Color = Color.White,

    //  Time to live is how long the particles should live. It randomly chooses between the
    //  min and the max value.  If all particles should live the same amount of time, set
    //  both min and max to the same value
    TimeToLive = new MinMaxFloat() { Minimum = 1.0f, Maximum = 1.5f },

    //  Count is the total number of particles to generate
    Count = 30,

    //  Velocity is the xy-velocity that is applied to the particles. It randomly chooses between
    //  the min and max value. If all particles should move at the same rate, then set min and max
    //  to the same value
    Velocity = new MinMaxFloat() { Minimum = 1.0f, Maximum = 4.0f },

    //  RotationVelocity is the velocity that is applied to the rotation of the of the particles.
    //  It randomly chooses between the min and max value.  If all particles shoudl rotate with
    //  the same velocity, set min and max to the same value
    RotationVelocity = new MinMaxFloat() { Minimum = 1.0f, Maximum = 2.0f },

    //  Scale is the xy scale that is applied to the particles when rendered. It randomly choose
    //  between the min and max values.  If all particles should scale the same, set min and max
    //  to the same value
    Scale = new MinMaxFloat() { Minimum = 0.1f, Maximum = 1.0f },

    //  Fade sets if the particles should fade out over the duration of the time they are alive.
    //  Set true to fade, or false to not fade
    Fade = false
};
