# Particle Class
Namespace: ParticleEmitter

Represents a single particle within the ParticleEmitter. 

```csharp
public class Particle
```

# Remarks
Partile instances are generated by the ParticleEmitter and do not need to be instantiated manually.  

# Constructors
| Signature | Description |
|---|---|
| Particle(Texture2D, Vector2, Vector2, float, float float, float, Color, bool) | Initilizes a new instnace of the Particle class with the values given |

# Properties
| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Alpha | float | Gets the opacity that is applied when rendering the Particle. |
| Color | Color | Gets the color mask that is applied when rendering the Particle. |
| Position | Vector2 | Gets the xy-coordinate location of the Particle. |
| Rotation | float | Gets the angle of rotation applied when rendering the Particle. |
| RotationVelocity | float | Gets the velocity that is applied to the Rotation of the Particle. |
| Scale | float | Gets the scale that is applied when rendering the Particle. |
| Texture | Texture2D | Gets the Texture2D that is applied when rendering the Particle. |
| TimeToLive | float | Gets the value indicating how long the Particle is allowed to live. |
| TotalTimeAlive | float | Gets the value indicating how long the Particle has been alive. |
| Velocity | Vector2 | Gets the x and y velocity that is applied to the Particle. |

# Methods
| Signature | Description |
|---|---|
| AddedToEmitter(Emiiter) | Called by the Emitter when the particle is added to the master list within the Emitter. |
| Draw(SpriteBatch) | Renders the particle |
| RemovedFromEmitter(Emitter) | Called by the Emitter when the particle is removed from the master list within the Emitter. |
| Update(GameTime) | Updates the particle.  **Use this overload if you are passing the GameTime refernece down through your update calls.** |
| Update(float) | Updates the particle.  **Use this overload if you already have a delta time value calculated.** |
